		In this case module I practiced debugging and fixing errors using different methods including window.alert(), 
		console.log(), HTML validation, analyzing logic, comments, the debugger and breakpoints. I intentionally made some errors to 
		give me the task of debugging and fixing my code. First thing is I let off a script for my calculator function. Analyzing my 
		function wasn’t responding I logically checked my html code to see if I put in the function realizing I forgot to include my file 
		in the JavaScript tag. Then I put in incorrect mathematical operators for my calculator function. I fixed this in two different 
		ways. I first used breakpoints in my html code where I called the functions and, in my JavaScript, where I did the computation. 
		I realized after stepping through it was a logical error and I incorrectly used the wrong mathematical operations.
		
		Then I incorrectly misspelled my num1 and num2 variables I needed in my calculator function for multiplying. After using the 
		debugger tool in chrome I  was given the error message that my variables were undefined. I commented out just my divide function 
		to run my multiplication function to help me in realizing I misspelled my num1 and num2 identifiers. To check if I was still 
		getting the right logical answers, I used the console.log () method to record the values to realize I wasn’t getting the logical 
		answers I intended. I checked my mathematical operators to realize I was adding and subtracting instead of dividing.
		
		Then I made some intentional errors with my switch statement in my automation page. I also left some closing tags off in my html 
		code. I checked this with the html validation to realize I forgot to put a closing tag for my head and body elements in my html 
		page. Duh! Then I when ran my page my programmer occupation wasn’t giving me the correct salary. I used a windolw.alert() to check 
		the value for the occupation variable before it was getting passed to the switch statement and the value after. I saw I was getting
		the incorrect answer of asking to choose an occupation. I checked my switch statement to see I forgot to put in a break for one of
		my cases so I was going to the default case for the programmer.
